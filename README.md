### Labs

#### Lab 1: Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Monte Carlo Prediction, Monte Carlo control with epsilon-greedy policy, Temporal Difference Learning

In this lab we get familiar with basic concepts of Dynammic Programming and use it for the implementation of Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration  and Value Iteration for GridWorld Environment. We also implement Monte Carlo Prediction and Monte Carlo control with epsilon-greedy policy on Blackjack Environment. Apart from that we also explore Temporal Difference Learning. 

#### Problems and Solutions

Problema and solution can be found under **ipynb** files [here](Labs/lab_1).

#### Lab 2: Deep Q-Network, Policy Gradient, Monte Carlo REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, Deep Reinforcement Learning

#### Problems and Solutions

Problema and solution can be found under **ipynb** files [here](Labs/lab_2).

## Homeworks:

Problems and Solutions to the homework assignment can be found [here](Homework).
